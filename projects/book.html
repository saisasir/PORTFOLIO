                    <h2>Overview</h2>  
                    <p>School libraries often have workspaces that serve as great study spots. During peak hours, however, finding an open space can be time and energy-consuming. In order to make finding a place to study less stressful for students, I conceptualized MITbook, a workspace reservation app for easy availability checking and booking in my school's libraries.</p>

                    <h2>User research and synthesis</h2>  
                    <p>To build a better understanding of how students view workspaces in the university libraries and how they approach finding one, I conducted 10 one-on-one interviews with MIT students. When recruiting research participants, I was mindful of getting a diverse range in class years and frequency in which they use the libraries.
                    <br><br>
                    From the interviews, it became evident that students using library workspaces largely fell under one of three categories: those doing individual work who prefer to sit alone, those doing individual work who prefer to sit with friends, and those doing group work. Several pain points also came to light, identified below.

                    <p>
                    Based on the findings, I defined my project goal: an app that allows busy students, who have varying needs and preferences, to intuitively find and secure library workspaces. I then drew up a storyboard for how MITbook could fit in to address some frustrations, and started thinking about the app's structure and actions.

Overall, the goal was to streamline the process of finding and reserving a workspace for all user types. The user flow for booking a workspace is shown below.
                
                    Additionally, an experimental feature of Book is the ability to make study groups "public" to other students when booking a group workspace, allowing other students to join. This streamlines the process of creating, scheduling, and finding study groups. -->
